        The Taj Mahals history begins in 1631, when Mughal emperor Shah Jahan
        ordered its creation following the death of his wife Mumtaz Mahal. His
        deep grief drove the project forward, mobilizing artisans,
        calligraphers, and craftsmen from across the empire. Construction
        formally began in 1632 under imperial supervision.

        Over the next two decades, the site evolved into a monumental expression
        of Shah Jahans rule and personal loss. Historical records describe
        continuous labor involving thousands of workers and significant imperial
        resources. By 1653, the mausoleum complex was completed, marking one of
        the most ambitious undertakings of the Mughal era.
