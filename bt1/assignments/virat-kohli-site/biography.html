        Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi, where he grew up in a
        middle-class family with strong encouragement toward academics and
        sports. From a young age, he showed a natural inclination toward
        cricket, joining the West Delhi Cricket Academy at just nine years old.
        His childhood coaches often recalled his discipline, energy, and desire
        to compete against stronger opponents.

        He rose through Indias age-group cricket quickly, earning attention
        during the 2008 U-19 Cricket World Cup, which India won under his
        captaincy. Soon after, he made his debut for the senior national team,
        gradually cementing his place through determination and adaptability.
        Over the years, Kohli evolved from a promising youngster into a central
        figure in Indian cricket, admired for his commitment and growth.
